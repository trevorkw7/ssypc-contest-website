The Seattle Summer Youth Photography Contest is local, student-run photography contest that aims to encourage high school students to pursue photography as an outlet for artistic creation. As high school students who are passionate about photography, we founded the SSYPC after noticing the lack of photography competitions being held in the summer, which is an important time for students to pursue hobbies and external interests when they are less busy. 

Unlike other long-running photography contests, we designed the submission window for the SSYPC to only be 30 days. When paired with the competition rules that require the photo submission to be taken within the 30-day window, the SSYPC becomes a very fast-paced photography contest. This is because our goal for the SSYPC is to make photography more engaging for students and to motivate students to go out and shoot during summer. So, go out, get some awesome shots, and submit them the SSYPC. What are you waiting for?
